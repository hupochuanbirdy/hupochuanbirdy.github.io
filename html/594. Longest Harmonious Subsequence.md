# „ÄêTwo pointers„Äë594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence <font size="3" color="02C850">Easy</font>

We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is **exactly** `1`.

Given an integer array `nums`, return *the length of its longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences*.

A **subsequence** of array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,2,2,5,2,3,7]
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest harmonious subsequence is [3,2,2,2,3].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 2
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`

## üí°Solution

```java
    public int findLHS(int[] nums) {
        int count = 0;
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int left = 0;
        int right = left + 1;
        while (right < nums.length && left < nums.length){
            while( nums[right] - nums[left] > 1){
                left++;
            }
            if( nums[right] - nums[left] == 1){
                count = Math.max(count, (right - left) + 1);
            }
            right++;
        }
        return count;
    }
```
