- Tell us about yourself.

Hi, my name is yejia yang, I'm a graduate student in computer science. My undergraduate background is “network engineering”. So I know a little about network protocols, and network security, but I really like coding, I perfer to use some frameworks such as(spring-boot, spring MVC); at the same time, I also use some kind of Front-end framework, like Layui, vant, uni-app, Angular, VUE, bootstrap. of cause I use some database tools, such as Mysql，sql server，mangoDB，neo4j， Non-relational databases

in addition, I built my personal website to record my life and post some coding problems , 

I know that technology has changed year and year, so Learning is never-ending, typically I try to write a mini project to familiarize new techniques. I like to learn and accept something new and enjoy the process of learning.



- What has been your experience of university?

In my undergraduate College, I had some different kinds of projects and experiences, 

In my freshman year, I used C++ to write a lexical system and a small exe tool for modifying the batch of the files name.

in my second year, to familiarize myself with the java network programming taught by my teacher, I wrote a LAN（Local Area Network） chat room.

In my third year of university, I started a Sudoku club and wrote a permission management system using springMAC and JSP in order to electronically manage the club members and publish regular Sudoku puzzles. Later, as the WeChat mini-program gradually appeared in our lives, I learnt the syntax of the mini-program. I found some very good frameworks to use in the mini-program, such as VUE, uni-app and Vant.



During my graduate studies, I learnt some ML skills, I wrote a naive bayesian classifier to identify poisonous or edible mushrooms. 

In my thesis, I defined a protocol to realise multi-hop communication in the mobile ad-hoc network.

In addition to the above, I am good at sports, I was also a member of the varsity orienteering team.

- Tell us about your work experience.

Honestly, I only have 10 months of experience in back-end development, I used to work in an IoT and construction company, it’s a small company with only 10 staff members. so, although I was a back-end developer, I also did other work, like front-end, database, and UI design. I can't say I'm good at everything but I've got the basics. 

My daily work was developing REST services using Spring Framework and servlet which is based on mqtt protocol.  

Or Maintained online software and added new functions.

In this company, I rebuild their official website including web page design and server-side design, and I created a new function in the website, which is an online chat and wechat combined.

Yeah, that is my work in my short company life, Technically I don't just work on the back end, my work is rather messy, but I do enjoy learning.





You know, staff members don’t have enough time to notice some new message in our dashboard. So I improved the function of message notification that I combined with the WeChat mini-program, once our clients send some messages, our official mini-program will notify some reverent staff members because everyone uses the WeChat app every day, and that is a free method compared with using SMS messages.



Totally, I spent a lot of time combining WeChat and our official website, because WeChat has many restrictions on third-party users.

Besides that, I also finished a new function in the mobile terminal, which is viewing real-time video of the production line. The video streaming process is a bit tricky because the platform we use is WeChat mini-program, not all stream formats WeChat can authorize, you know, the program platform for live video in smart homes is implemented in Android or IOS, but I still finished it.



Although I had little knowledge about how to handle streaming, I felt a little bit challenged at first, I really like the progress from 0 to 80%, I won’t say 100%,

Yeah, that is my work in my short company life, Technically I don't just work on the back end, my work is rather messy, but I do enjoy learning.



- How has your education/experience prepared you for this role?

I really want to find some kind of job which silks I have,









- What kinds of activities do you enjoy outside of work and study?

In my spare time, I enjoy photography and being an unprofessional photographer,

I also like to practice kendo and I've already got my Level 1 certificate.



- What has been your proudest achievement to date?

I did a lot of work for myself, I love coding, and I would say I made an ad-free reading app for my mon, she is a fan of fiction, I use python crawler to get hundreds of novels, and I feel a sense of accomplishment to use my ability to make my mon happy.



- Tell us about your summer in the UK/Ireland this year.

Nowhere



- Why did you choose your degree?

I love my bachelor's study life, so I want to continue in the same field, I think the major is very interesting and in this day and age technology is changing very quickly and sometimes what you learn at school may be outdated at work. The non-stop learning process is a challenge and an achievement.



-  What are your most/least favourite modules in the degree and why?

Not really, it’s hard to say, in my previous college, I don’t like hardware courses such as Digital circuit design, because I need to know where the wires need to be connected to the different types of boards, once I made a mistake, The circuit board may have been broken by me, I was really confused and frustrated when I took that class, however, this is the compulsory course I had to take.

Well, My favourite modules are all coding courses, such as Scalable Computing, yeah, that's the name, even though I know little about Machine learning, I still like, it because I can learn new knowledge when I go through my assignments. 















- What your most/least favourite internship/project/role? And why?

I really want to find some kind of position related to my skills, 



- Why did you apply for this job?

I viewed the job description when I applied for this job, and I noticed and think this job is suitable for me, some silks I already know, and some silks which I am unfamiliar with I want to use practical cases to improve my ability. 



For me, that is a new challenge, 







- Why would you like to work here?





- What would you like to achieve in the next 3-5 years?







- What are your strengths?





- What are your greatest weaknesses?



- How would your last manager describe you?



- How would your best friend describe you?





- How would your worst enemy describe you?

Stubborn? Tenacious？



- What would people be surprised to know about you?

garbage collection, 





GC root, how does java know if an object is eligible for garbage collection





s. When Java programs run on the JVM(Java Virtual Machine), objects are created on the heap, which is a portion of memory dedicated to the program. Eventually, some objects will no longer be needed. The garbage collector finds these unused objects and deletes them to free up memory.



But in Java, the programmer need not care for all those objects which are no longer in use. Garbage collector destroys these objects. The main objective of the Garbage Collector is to free heap memory by destroying unreachable objects. The garbage collector is the best example of the Daemon thread as it is always running in the background.
